# Library

JS: LIBRARY. This is the first javaScript project of "The Odin Project". In this project, we have used one of the common design pattern i.e. Objects and Object Constructors. We have made use of prototypes and prototypal inheritance.

Later on, we have refactored our code to use the classes instead of plain object constructors.

app.js file consists of latest refactored code using JS classes while app-old.js file consists of old code that uses plain object constructors.
